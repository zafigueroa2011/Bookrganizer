# Bookrganizer
A PERSONAL CATALOG APPLICATION
INTRODUCTION

Bookrganizer is a personal catalog application for books, movies, and games. The user can add movies, books and/or games to their catalog. They also can view their items on their dashboard and view the item’s details. Items can be deleted from the catalog. Users can send messages to other users and view each message sent and received. Also, users can edit their profile and change their password.

PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
The focus of the project is creating a catalog app where users can view and edit their catalog and communicate with other users. Bookrganizer is a record keeping application. The application collects three distinct types of data: numerical (rating, year, ISBN, etc.), textual (title, messages, genre, etc.), and images. The application prototype can be found at: https://pr.to/HY2RRB/. The colors, fonts, and style of the application is different from the prototype but the structure of the pages and application is almost the same.
Next are the software specifications of the application like what programming languages was used, development environment, tools, extensions, etc.

Programming Languages, Libraries and Frameworks
I used HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery, and AngularJS for the front-end of the application. The front-end structure and platform was created using the Angular Template Hot Towel by John Papa. For the back-end I used NodeJS, and Express structure of the back-end was based on Visual Studio NodeJS with Express Project Solution. MongoDB was the database and I use Mongoose as my object modeling tool between MongoDB and my back-end.

IDE
I chose Visual Studio 2017 as my IDE since I am very familiar with it and I have used before for other applications. 

Tools
I used the NodeJS Console for visual studio to install packages using the npm; the Package Manager Console of VS2017 to install the Hot Towel Template. I also used VS2017 to create and automatically update the json file. I used MongoDB Compass to access the database to view and add tables and documents.
